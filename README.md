## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. So, that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Description: Servers and APIs
External APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in their context, frequently consuming this data via a server. My task is to build a weather dashboard application that calls the OpenWeather API and renders data in the browser.The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Render.

## Installation
To install and run this application locally, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository via SSH:

`git clone git@github.com: elele20005/SkyScope-Dashboard.git`
       
   Navigate to the Project Directory


 command: `cd SkyScope-Dashboard`
 
Install Dependencies

Copy code
command:  `npm install`

## Usage

I will be Using the 5-day weather forecast API to retrieve weather data for cities:       

https://openweathermap.org/forecast5.


The base URL should look like the following:    

`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`


After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys

https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys  

And Render documentation on setting environment variables 

https://docs.render.com/configure-environment-variables

Also add your `server` and `api scripts` in the scripts section of package.json      

Exaple below:

`{ `        
`"scripts": { `     
` "server": "node server.js",  `    
  ` "api": "node api.js",  `      
   ` "start": "npm run server & npm run api"  `       
         `     } `       
         `}`      

command: `npm run server` will start the server (server.js file).      
Command: `npm run api` will start the API (api.js file).          
command: `npm start` runs both server and api scripts concurrently
